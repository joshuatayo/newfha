			<p>This year, 2023 marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of Federal Housing Authority. The organization came into existence through the provisions of Decree No 40 of 1973 as a Federal Government parastatal, under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing. The Decree was reviewed to Laws of Nigeria CAP 136 of 1990.
FHA started operations in Lagos in 1976, when the then Military Government of Nigeria decided to set up an agency that would manage the accommodation built to host the participants of the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, FESTAC, which the country hosted. The event was the major factor that conceived the idea of the Festival Town
The Black Arts Festival Town, as it was originally known, had a twin objective; a short – term one, to provide adequate accommodation for the participants and visitors to the Festival and a long – term one to create within the National Housing Programme, a model township in the Lagos Metropolitan Area to relieve some of the severe housing pressures experienced in the largest, fastest growing urban complex of the country.
The construction activities in the Festival Town started between the end of 1974 and the beginning of 1975 and by 1976, the project was ready to offer the essential facilities and decent accommodation to the participants and visitors to FESTAC.
In December 1992, under a performance agreement between the Authority, the Federal Government and the Technical Committee on Privatization and Commercialization (TCPC), now the Bureau of Public Enterprise (BPE), FHA became a public enterprise serving both as a government agency for housing delivery and a commercial enterprise, earning profit to sustain its operations, to perform the following functions:
⦁ Preparation and submission of proposals to the government, on national housing programmes.
⦁ Development and management of real estates on commercial and profitable basis in all states of the federation.
⦁ Provision of Site and Services schemes for the benefit of all income groups.
Making recommendations to government on such aspects of urban and regional planning, electricity, sewage and water supply, transportation as may be relevant to the execution of approved housing programme.

The mission statement for the Authority as enumerated by the TCPC is to “pursue the objective of developing affordable housing facilities by organizing an efficient utilization of available resources as provided for in the National Housing Policy. This is with a view to improving the standard of living and quality of Nigerians particularly the low income group through commercial and profitable operations of Government funded housing programmes.

Since inception, the Authority has had 26 Chief Executives with Mr. SPO Fortune Ebie as the first General Manager. In 1993, Engr Abubakar Aliyu Yabo became the First Chief Executive with the title of Managing Director. Of these CEOs, there were two Sole Administrators and three Military Administrator and one Executive Chairman.
